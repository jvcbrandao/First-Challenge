    <p>Have you ever thought about learning a new language? what about ...?<mark>What about a programming languages?</mark> So, today we are going to explore some amazing <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language"> HTML</abbr>. Even though it is not a programming language, I am pretty sure that you'll have fun.</p>

    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <small><a href="#top">return</a></small>
    <p>Tim Berners-Lee came up with this idea called <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language"> HTML</abbr>, it stands for <strong>H</strong>iper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. Nowadays it is everywhere beacause we use HTML to build the cornestone of any website. So we can create a ton of things, we can organize all of the elements in a webpage very easily.
    <p>Those were my words. If you want to hear from someone else, let's take a look at what the website W<sup>3</sup> Schools says about it</p>
    
    <del>If you fall in love with HTML, I won't be able to assist you.</del>
    
    <blockquote>
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
        <ul>
            <li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
            <li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
            <li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
            <li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <h1>Tags</h1>

    <small><a href="#top">return</a></small>
    <p>When we talk about HTML, tags are what we use to create and organize a well-constructed page. Since HTML was developed by an English speaker, all of the tags make a lot of sense when you think about them. Now, we are going to talk about some of them.</p>
